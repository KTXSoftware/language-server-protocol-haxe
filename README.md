[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vshaxe/language-server-protocol-haxe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vshaxe/language-server-protocol-haxe)

This is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).

It's used by the [Haxe Language Server](https://github.com/vshaxe/haxe-languageserver) and was separated from it
so one could implement their own client and/or server using Haxe.

**Protocol version**: 3.0 ([protocol.md 2a15019](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/commit/2a15019a4b7cb915db6b2cf10e9a701ade7bad1a))
